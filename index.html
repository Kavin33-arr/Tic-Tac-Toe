                <ul>
                <li>The traditional version of Tic-Tac-Toe must be played on a 3Ã—3 grid that incorporates 9 squares. </li>
                <li>Players must select their mark before the game starts (either X or O) and must play the entire game using the same mark.</li>
                <li>Players must take turns, making only 1 mark with each turn.</li>
                <li>Marks can only be placed in empty squares, and once it is placed, it is permanent.</li>
                <li>The winner is the first player to get 3 of their marks in a straight line (the line can be positioned diagonally, vertically, or horizontally).</li>
                <li>The game is over when all 9 squares are filled with marks, even if none of the players have a straight line of 3 marks.</li>
                <li>If neither player has a straight line of 3 marks, it is considered a tie.</li>
                </ul>
